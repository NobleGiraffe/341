-- 5. Based on the calculation in 4 (use the computed value, not a hard coded one),
-- return the orders which are in 'Pending' or 'Processing' states (question 3)
-- which are exceeding the average from the current date stored in @today
-- and may require expedited priority.
-- The table should return the columns

-- sorted starting from the longest DAYS_SINCE_ORDER. 
-- EXAMPLE
-- input: SET @today = '2018-03-21'
-- 22 rows returned

# ORDER_ID, DAYS_SINCE_ORDER
# '1430', '11'
